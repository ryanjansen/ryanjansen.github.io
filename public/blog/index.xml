      <description>Semester Reflections The first semester of university has flown by and is coming to an end soon. I would like to take some time to reflect on my experience, as well as keep a log of sorts of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing during the semester 12 weeks seems to be a long time in theory, but it&amp;rsquo;s gone in a flash in reality. I wonder if this is what the rest of uni life will be like.</description>

      <description>I want to improve. I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of us have thought that to ourselves at one point. Sucking at something is a universal experience, after all. And yet, how often have we seen this thought through to the end? How often have we pushed ourselves to the limit, constantly reaching, but never grasping that level of mastery or ability that we wish for? I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that most of us do.</description>

      <description>Starting something new is scary. We are creatures of habit, and anything that wrenches us outside of our comfy shell can feel terrifying, or at least unsettling. That was how I felt two weeks ago when I began my university life. Unsettled. That feeling of possibility laced with anxiety reminded me of a similar time six months earlier when I began my first internship at NodeFlair. Or 2 years ago when I began my national service in the police force.</description>

      <description>Most people of my generation use social media. On any train or bus ride, take a look around you. I bet that the majority will be scrolling through instagram or facebook. For most of us, it is a part of our daily lives.
I am one of the minority that does not use social media. There are many reasons why I don&amp;rsquo;t do so, and I would like to briefly explain them in this post.</description>
