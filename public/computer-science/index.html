  <p>This is where I put all my notes from CS in the hope of helping others who might need them.</p>
<h1 id="main-areas-of-cs">Main Areas of CS</h1>
<p>There are a few core areas of CS which the NUS curriculum follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming</li>
</ol>
<p>This includes programming paradigms like functional programming, OOP, etc. Also has interesting stuff like recursion, abstraction, and how to approach problems in a way that a computer would.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Computer Architecture</li>
</ol>
<p>How computers work. The world of CPUs, RAM, NAND Gates and other fun stuff. One of the more difficult areas of CS IMO.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Math</li>
</ol>
<p>Mostly discrete math, with some linear algebra and calculus lumped in. Consists of proofs, graphs, recursions, functions and loads more.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where the fun begins. Using the power of computers to solve problems blazingly fast. Also very important in coding interviews, so has implications for your future career.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Networking</li>
</ol>
<p>The internet is more complicated than it seems. Commonly represented in 5 layers, the physical, link, network, transport and application layers. Common protocols such as IP, TCP, IMAP, MAC and Ethernet are found here.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Operating Systems</li>
</ol>
<p>The thing that runs on your computer and lets you actually use it. How a kernel manages everything and stuff.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Compilers and Programming Languages</li>
</ol>
<p>Wrting programs that write programs</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Everything else</li>
</ol>
<p>Databases, automata theory, AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, the list goes on&hellip;</p>
<p>I will update this page with notes and resources over time, so make sure to check back in regularly!</p>
