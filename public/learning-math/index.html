  <p>Why is math so hard.</p>
<h1 id="what-im-learning">What I&rsquo;m Learning</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to learn some discrete math in preparation for my CS course. Even though I&rsquo;ve been learning for almost a year, the sporadic nature of my studying has really hindered my ability to retain concepts.</p>
<p>More specfically, I&rsquo;m going through this great discrete math book that I found online called The Book of Proofs. It&rsquo;s a really simple and straightforward introduction to discrete math and I recommend it to anyone that is interested (or forced to study) this topic.</p>
<p>It breaks down proofs into a few areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct proof</li>
<li>Proof by cases</li>
<li>Proof by contrapositive</li>
<li>Proof by contradiction</li>
</ol>
<p>I am currently stuck solving problems at the contropositive section. It&rsquo;s slow going and I wonder if I will be able to finish it by the time my course actually starts. One thing I am grateful for is that I chose to start earlier. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;s like to learn these concepts for the first time in class.</p>
<p>Back in JC I was never very consistent when it came to my study habits, which is why I want to try to make up for it in university. I have come to realise that slow and steady really does beat cramming and mugging the night before.</p>
<p>Even though learning someothing new like math is difficult, it can also be rewarding in its own way. I savor the satisfaction that comes with solving a difficult problem, the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve come to really understand something. There is just nothing else like it. I don&rsquo;t know many people that feel this way, but I hope that more people can feel this too.</p>
<p>After all, isn&rsquo;t math supposed to be a workout for our minds? Just as we work our muscles, so too must we exercise our brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Ciao.</p>
