      <description>Why is math so hard.
What I&amp;rsquo;m Learning I&amp;rsquo;m starting to learn some discrete math in preparation for my CS course. Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning for almost a year, the sporadic nature of my studying has really hindered my ability to retain concepts.
More specfically, I&amp;rsquo;m going through this great discrete math book that I found online called The Book of Proofs. It&amp;rsquo;s a really simple and straightforward introduction to discrete math and I recommend it to anyone that is interested (or forced to study) this topic.</description>

      <description>This is where I put all my notes from CS in the hope of helping others who might need them.
Main Areas of CS There are a few core areas of CS which the NUS curriculum follows:
 Programming  This includes programming paradigms like functional programming, OOP, etc. Also has interesting stuff like recursion, abstraction, and how to approach problems in a way that a computer would.
Computer Architecture  How computers work.</description>
