This is where I put all my notes from CS in the hope of helping others who might need them. 

# Main Areas of CS

There are a few core areas of CS which the NUS curriculum follows:

1. Programming

This includes programming paradigms like functional programming, OOP, etc. Also has interesting stuff like recursion, abstraction, and how to approach problems in a way that a computer would.

2. Computer Architecture

How computers work. The world of CPUs, RAM, NAND Gates and other fun stuff. One of the more difficult areas of CS IMO.

3. Math

Mostly discrete math, with some linear algebra and calculus lumped in. Consists of proofs, graphs, recursions, functions and loads more.

4. Algorithms and Data Structures

This is where the fun begins. Using the power of computers to solve problems blazingly fast. Also very important in coding interviews, so has implications for your future career.

5. Networking

The internet is more complicated than it seems. Commonly represented in 5 layers, the physical, link, network, transport and application layers. Common protocols such as IP, TCP, IMAP, MAC and Ethernet are found here.

6. Operating Systems

The thing that runs on your computer and lets you actually use it. How a kernel manages everything and stuff.

7. Compilers and Programming Languages

Wrting programs that write programs

8. Everything else

Databases, automata theory, AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, the list goes on...

I will update this page with notes and resources over time, so make sure to check back in regularly!
