Why is math so hard. 

# What I'm Learning

I'm starting to learn some discrete math in preparation for my CS course. Even though I've been learning for almost a year, the sporadic nature of my studying has really hindered my ability to retain concepts. 

More specfically, I'm going through this great discrete math book that I found online called The Book of Proofs. It's a really simple and straightforward introduction to discrete math and I recommend it to anyone that is interested (or forced to study) this topic. 

It breaks down proofs into a few areas: 

1. Direct proof
2. Proof by cases
3. Proof by contrapositive
4. Proof by contradiction

I am currently stuck solving problems at the contropositive section. It's slow going and I wonder if I will be able to finish it by the time my course actually starts. One thing I am grateful for is that I chose to start earlier. I can't imagine what it's like to learn these concepts for the first time in class. 

Back in JC I was never very consistent when it came to my study habits, which is why I want to try to make up for it in university. I have come to realise that slow and steady really does beat cramming and mugging the night before. 

Even though learning someothing new like math is difficult, it can also be rewarding in its own way. I savor the satisfaction that comes with solving a difficult problem, the knowledge that you've come to really understand something. There is just nothing else like it. I don't know many people that feel this way, but I hope that more people can feel this too. 

After all, isn't math supposed to be a workout for our minds? Just as we work our muscles, so too must we exercise our brain. 

That's all for now. Ciao.
